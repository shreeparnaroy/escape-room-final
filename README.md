The rules of a game should be balanced. ----This means if the game is too difficult, people will not play it. If the game is too easy, people will not find it challenging enough to spend time on it.

Another very good characteristic of games is that they give immediate feedback to the player on how they are doing.----- score----life---gameSound----points---change in animation
Lastly, all games tell a story. Some games tell a story made by the game designers. Other games allow the player to infer a story through gameplay
